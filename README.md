Emacs Prelude Customized By Hanks
=================================

This is a modified version of Prelude for me. You can check the original awesome Emacs settings <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude">here</a>. I use Emacs for a long time, but just for the simple usage, and base on my own configurations collected from internet, actually speaking it is a little buggy. When I checked Prelude and other emacs package repos, I just want to say `It's rocks`. So I decided to use this repo to manage my Emacs settings.

## Installation

### 1. Installing Emacs 24

Obviously to use the Emacs Prelude you have to install Emacs 24
first. Have a look at the [WikEmacs articles on installing Emacs](http://wikemacs.org/index.php/Installing_Emacs).  

After you install the original Emacs 24, and **Do Not Open It** and execute the steps below.

### 2. Installing Modified Prelude 

```bash
cd ~
export PRELUDE_URL="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude.git" && curl -L https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude/raw/master/utils/installer.sh | sh
```

## Run
At this time, just open Emacs and wait, and it will do the configuration automatically. Then Happy Coding!
